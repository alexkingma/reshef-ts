recreate RoD

goal:
  recreate as much of reshef as possible, excluding some minor balancing/duel mechanics aspects
  all graphics/sounds/plot stuff should be as accurate as possible

rough order of tasks:
  headless duel engine (dump game state in console)
  duel UI
  world exploration (shop, deck editing, challenge different players/sprites, etc.)
  basic opponent AI (make two versions: one with canon AI, one with actual smart AI)
  create a line of all (major) duellists at all stages of the game, effectively a practice tool with no fluff/dialogue/cutscenes
  pit the duellists against each other to determine their Elo, including new and old AI versions
  recreate dialogue/events/cutscenes/plot (VERY low priority)

eventual improvements over original game:
	no cursor/effect monster spam
	can sell last card in trunk
	remove unsellable cards from shop sell menu
	cards sell for 25% of buy price instead of 5%
	place SoRL and field spells on field
	rebalance cost of cards (not purely determined by the higher of atk/def)
	prevent discarding from hand (or maybe just don't send discarded cards to graveyard, delete them outright)
	show opponent hand when panning up
	allow deck to go above 40 cards while editing it (and to go up to 60 if desired? why not if you have the DC for it?)
	rebalance DC/DL given by harder duellists
	make bonz 1 a wasteland field
	prevent starting a new game from deleting save data
	alignment gives 500 atk/def bonus, not isntakill effect
	setting def mode and failing to attack during SoRL doesn't lock card with "E" state
	remove intro logos
	fiend bonuses grant 2-300 atk/def instead of multiplying
	code system is replaced by a brochure (another "shop" interface) that lets you browse all cards and "buy" them into the shop for a function of their price (~20%)
  make type/effects of monsters more accurate
  make spell/trap effects more accurate
  lp is restored after each duel
eventual/complex ideas:
  expand graveyard to be more than one card
  allow more than 5 cards in hand
  move field spells to their own zone

pending duel features:
  duel state
    cursorPos
    whoseTurn
    hasNormalSummoned
    numTributedMonsters
    focusedMonster -- for when two selections are needed (X monster attacks Y enemy; X spell powers up Y monster)
  attack monster
  destroy monster
  attack directly
  change monster position
  activate spell
  activate trap
  activate monster effect
  end turn

major chunks of game state:
  duel -- see above
  player -- dl/dc, money, deck/trunk contents, coords/dirFacing
  trunk -- viewMode (atk/def, align, cost, etc.), sortOrder, cursorIdx
  shop -- cards in stock, sortKey, cursorPos
  world -- story/plot flags, available locations, npcs (coords/dirFacing, who has been duelled, conversation flags)
